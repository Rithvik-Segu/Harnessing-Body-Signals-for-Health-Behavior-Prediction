In our project, "Unveiling the True Power of Big Data," we are breaking new ground in Big Data Analytics with a mission to revolutionize healthcare. Our approach uses predictive analytics to foresee the likelihood of individuals starting to smoke or drink alcohol. We delve into a variety of factors, from personal lifestyle choices to physiological metrics like height and weight, aiming to proactively curb these harmful habits. Our method provides a comprehensive look at an individualâ€™s health by evaluating both their current and past behaviors alongside a spectrum of lifestyle and health indicators, giving us a well-rounded perspective on their well-being.
